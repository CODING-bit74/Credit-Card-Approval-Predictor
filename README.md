📊 Overview
This project uses a machine learning model to predict credit card approval outcomes. It processes input data like age, income, employment status, and credit history to make predictions using classifiers such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and AdaBoost.

🚀 Features
Preprocessing and cleaning of raw credit data

Support for multiple ML algorithms

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Ready for deployment using Streamlit or Flask (optional)

Modular, readable, and extensible code

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or a similar anonymized dataset containing fields like:

Gender, Age, Marital Status, Income, Employment, Credit Score

Loan Amount, Purpose, Existing Cards

Approved (Target variable: Yes/No)

Ensure you clean and preprocess missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical fields.

⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor.git
cd Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

(Optional: XGBoost, Logistic Regression)

Hyperparameters are optimized using GridSearchCV for accuracy.

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 1],
    'algorithm': ['SAMME', 'SAMME.R']
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(AdaBoostClassifier(), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
📈 Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision / Recall / F1-Score

ROC AUC (optional)

You can visualize results using matplotlib and seaborn.

🛠️ Technologies Used
